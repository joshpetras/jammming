# Jammming Spotify Playlist Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and built as part of the Codecademy Pro "Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch" course.

Jammming is a React web application that enables users to create and add playlists to their Spotify account. It does this by utilizing the Spotify API to connect and authenticate to a user's account, and to search for Tracks, Artists or Albums. The results are then presented in a list where individual tracks can easily be added to or removed from a new playlist. Once the playlist has been assembled, it can be given a name and then saved to the user's Spotify account with the click of a button.

## Features
- Spotify Login — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account.
- Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library.
- Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user's query.
- Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a `+` sign on the right side of the track's display container.
- Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a `-` sign on the right side of the track's display container.
- Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.
- Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.

## Instructions
1. Download or clone repo.
2. Navigate to the project folder in terminal.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Modify the `redirect_uri` variable on line 3 of 'src/util/Spotify.js' to the URL where you will be deploying the application.
5. Modify line 19 of 'src/util/Spotify.js' so that the third argument of the `pushState()` object matches the location where your application will be hosted.  For example, if you will be accessing your application from your root url such as `https://www.xyz.com/`, then the third argument should be `'/'`. If your application will be located in a subfolder such as `https://www.xyz.com/jamming/`, then the third argument should be set to `'/jammming/'`.
6. Run `npm run build` in the terminal to create the applications's production build.
7. Deploy the production build to your hosting service. Instructions for common deployment scenarios and providers can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment).
